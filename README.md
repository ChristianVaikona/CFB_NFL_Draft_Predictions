Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between NCAA football player performance and NFL Draft selection. The goal is to build a data-driven model that can analyze player statistics, identify key predictors, and estimate the likelihood of draft outcomes.

Key Features

Collect and clean NCAA and NFL draft data using Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Store and query structured data using MySQL

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization with Matplotlib/Seaborn

Apply machine learning models (e.g., regression, classification) with scikit-learn

Evaluate accuracy by comparing model predictions to actual draft results

Skills & Tools
Python, SQL (MySQL), Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Git/GitHub
