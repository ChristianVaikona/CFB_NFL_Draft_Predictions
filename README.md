# CFB NFL Draft Predictions

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between NCAA football player performance and NFL Draft outcomes. The goal is to collect and analyze college football statistics, identify key predictors, and build models that estimate a player's likelihood of being drafted.

## Objectives
- Collect and clean NCAA and NFL draft data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends
- Visualize insights with Python libraries
- Build predictive models using machine learning
- Compare predictions against actual draft results

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming:** Python, SQL (MySQL)  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Status
Currently collecting and documenting raw NFL Draft and college football performance data from Sports Reference. Preparing datasets for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to support predictive modeling.

## Next Steps
- Identify and source NCAA/NFL datasets  
- Load and clean data into MySQL and Pandas  
- Begin exploratory data analysis (EDA)
