# 🏈 CFB → NFL Draft Predictions

## 📘 Overview
This project explores the relationship between NCAA football player performance and NFL Draft outcomes.  
Using data science and machine learning, the goal is to analyze college football statistics, identify key predictors, and build models that estimate a player's likelihood of being drafted.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Collect and clean NCAA and NFL Draft data  
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and relationships  
- Visualize insights using Python data visualization libraries  
- Build predictive models to estimate draft outcomes  
- Compare model predictions against actual NFL Draft results  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Programming:** Python, SQL (MySQL)  
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## 📊 Current Status (October 2025)
- Collected 2021 NCAA season data (Passing, Rushing, Receiving) and 2023 NFL Draft data  
- Loaded and validated datasets in Pandas  
- Beginning exploratory data analysis (EDA) to inspect, clean, and understand data structure  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Clean and standardize NCAA datasets  
- Merge college player data with draft outcomes  
- Perform EDA visualizations (e.g., position-based trends, correlations)  
- Begin initial feature selection and modeling
