# CFB NFL Draft Predictions

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between NCAA football player performance and NFL Draft outcomes. The goal is to collect and analyze college football statistics, identify key predictors, and build models that estimate a player's likelihood of being drafted.

## Objectives
- Collect and clean NCAA and NFL draft data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends
- Visualize insights with Python libraries
- Build predictive models using machine learning
- Compare predictions against actual draft results

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming:** Python, SQL (MySQL)  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Status
Gathered 2021 college football and 2023 NFL draft data.
Beginning exploratory data analysis (EDA) to inspect, clean, and understand data structure.

## Next Steps
- Identify and source NCAA/NFL datasets
